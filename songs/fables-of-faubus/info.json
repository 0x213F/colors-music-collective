  "description": "This song takes us back to Little Rock, Arkansas, but our story actually begins in 1951, when Oliver Brown, a father in Topeka, Kansas, grew tired of watching his seven-year-old daughter Linda walk several miles to school each day, crossing dangerous railroad tracks, just to reach the all-Black elementary school - while a whites-only school sat just seven blocks from their home. The year prior, the NAACP had won Sweatt versus Painter, challenging segregation in higher education, and was pursuing many other cases across the country, with Brown versus Board becoming part of their strategic legal efforts to dismantle segregation. After a lengthy legal battle, the Supreme Court found in Brown's favor that the racist segregation of these schools was illegal not just for his daughter, but across the entire country. The 3 years of that legal battle now takes us from 1951 to 1954. With the victory, the civil rights movement picked up momentum. But over the next 3 years, Arkansas defied the Supreme Court's constitutional order, refusing to desegregate schools. That takes us to 1957, by which time Oliver Brown's little 7-year-old daughter was now 13 years old. It's September 4th, and finally, accompanied by their community members, nine Black students showed up for their first day of school at Central High School. They were met by a screaming, violent mob hurling slurs and threats, while Arkansas National Guard troops with rifles blocked their path on Governor Orval Faubus's orders."
