Haitian Fight Song
-----------------

Haitian Fight Song" was composed in the mid-1950s, during the burgeoning Civil Rights
Movement and just as significant social change was sweeping across the United States.

Mingus, a bass player, said he wrote this song while thinking about the injustices in the world,
and because of the success of the Haitian Revolution in ending slavery and French colonialism,
Haiti was used as a symbol of resistance.

From Mingus's album notes...

“Haitian Fight Song, to begin with, could just as well be called Afro-American Fight Song… I’d
say this song has a contemporary folk feeling. My solo in it is a deeply concentrated one. I can’t
play it right unless I’m thinking about prejudice and hate and persecution, and how unfair it is.
There’s sadness and cries in it, but also determination"
